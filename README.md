# packet_tracer_OSPF

In this networking project, I leveraged Cisco Packet Tracer to design and 
simulate a complex network topology consisting of three routers, where two of 
the routers had switches connected to them. Each switch was further connected to 
one PC, resulting in a total of three routers and two PCs. 

The project aimed to explore and deepen my understanding of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
routing, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for testing connectivity, and configuring 
network devices using the Cisco CLI.
